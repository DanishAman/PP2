Though few skeptics consider yoga as one of the six orthodox philosophical schools of Hinduism, its methods and effects are now being studied and accepted worldwide, with many research studies supporting how it enhances immunity and lung capacity.There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise, consisting largely of the postures or asanas, however that is through the Western lens. The word “yoga” essentially means “that which brings you in union with reality", and this could be through various methods.</p>

Yoga is mentioned in the Rigveda, and also referenced in the Upanishads, though it most likely developed as a systematic study around the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements. The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to the Upanishads. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the 2nd century BCE, and gained prominence in the west in the 20th century after being first introduced by Swami Vivekananda. Hatha yoga texts began to emerge sometime between the 9th and 11th century with origins in tantra.</p>

<p style="float: right; background-color: #E6D5B8; margin-top: 5px;  font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; width: 78%; padding-left: 2.2px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West, following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century with his adaptation of yoga tradition, excluding asanas. Outside India, it has developed into a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique. Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core. One of the six major orthodox darsanas, or schools, of Indian philosophy is also called Yoga darsana, has its own epistemological method, which assumes the ontology and metaphysics of the closely correlated Samkhya darsana. The Sanskrit noun yoga is derived from the sanskrit root yuj  "to attach, join, harness, yoke". The word yoga is cognate with English "yoke".The spiritual sense of the word yoga first arises in Epic Sanskrit, in the second half of the 1st millennium BCE, and is associated with the philosophical system presented in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, with the chief aim of "uniting" the human spirit with the Divine spirit. The term kriyāyoga has a technical meaning in the Yoga Sutras, designating the "practical" aspects of the philosophy, i.e. the "union with the supreme" through performance of duties in everyday life.</p>
